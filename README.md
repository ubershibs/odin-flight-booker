#Odin Flight Booker
Built this app as part of the Odin Project's Rails course, specifically the [Advanced Forms project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-advanced-forms) and a bit more with the [Mailer project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/sending-confirmation-emails). 

I've got it up and running in production on Heroku:

[https://secure-sands-80209.herokuapp.com](https://secure-sands-80209.herokuapp.com)

It's not the prettiest thing in the world, and there are no tests, but I intend to circle back and fix both those things, particularly once I get some of the HTML5/CSS3 course under my belt.

Right now, it:
- Searches for flights
- Passes your passenger # and selected flight to the booking form.
- Allows your to add details for your selected number of passengers
- Sends each passenger a confirmation email, with a link back to the booking details page.
